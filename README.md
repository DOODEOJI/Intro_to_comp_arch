# Project INFO

## proj1 - Disassembler
- Goal: Reads a binary file containing RISC-V machine code and **prints the assembly representation of the code**

## proj2 - single cycle RISC-V CPU Simulator
- Goal: implement an **instruction simulator** that suppports a subset of RISC-V instructions
- it supports arithmetic, logical, memory, jump, branch operations.
- for example: `add`, `sub`, `xor`, `and`, `slt`, `jal`, `beq`, `lw`, `sw`, etc.

## proj3 - Spike RISC-V simulator
- Goal: Study the cache simulation in the Spike RISC-V instruction simulator and **Modify the simulator to implement the LRU replacement algorithm**.
